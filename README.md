## Contributing

After editing the code, run it through our checks:
```console
pip install -r requirements.txt
black presspy tests
flake8
pytest
```

Black should return something along the lines of:
```console
All done! ‚ú® üç∞ ‚ú®
1 file reformatted, 3 files left unchanged.
```

Flake8 should return any other formatting errors and a count, so you should see:
```console
0
```

Last, Pytest should tell you:
```console
